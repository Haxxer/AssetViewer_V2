# AssetViewer_V2
 Work in progress for the new version of the asset viewer

**The assets are located in a folder called jb2a_patreon but only the free ones are in this repository.**

- Need to find a way to ignore the _template properties of some of the objects
- Need to figure out why the Club entry is broken
- Need to rework the UI. Not sure the letters on the side nor the dropdown idea is the best way forward
